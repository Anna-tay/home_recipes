Website to store and access recipes that people have uploaded. A way to share recipes that is simple and lasting.

## OverView
- Recipe Box is a dedicated platform for sharing and utilizing recipes. The website primarily utilizes Python and HTML as its core programming languages.

## Recipe Website 
- This website serves as a platform where users can both upload and view recipes. Users have the flexibility to add their own recipes and browse through the database for any culinary inspiration. The goal of this site is to provide a reliable way for users to access recipes they know and love.

- I designed this platform with college students in mind, enabling them to easily use the recipes they grew up with, eliminating the need to print them all out and struggle to find them later. It's a convenient space to bring a bit of home into their lives and to explore new recipes as well.

## Development Environment
- To run the website I am using Python flask. For all font end I use HTML, CSS a bit of java and python. Back end is a firebase firestore Database and storage.
This program only uses python to interact with that database.

## future work
- Having an account database that saves users information and allows them to save and update the recipes they have added.
- Add an about page.
- Allow people to commit on recipes.
